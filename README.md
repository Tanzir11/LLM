# LLM
If i had pushed the model on hugging face i would have used **handler.py** to perform inferencing.
**scrape.ipynb** has the scraping data, finetuning on replicate as well as codes to fine tune on any cloud GPU platform.
**Streamlit.ipynb** is the file that makes streamlit app by calling the model through replicate. 
**course.jsonl** is the json line data format that is required by the LLM's to get finetuned. 
**course_data.csv** has over view of scraped data.
